  - [ ] Implement level progression logic
  - [ ] Implement timer system
  - [ ] Add difficulty scaling calculations

- [ ] Create Bubble class (bubble.js)
  - [ ] Implement bubble physics (movement, collision)
  - [ ] Implement bubble rendering with gradients
  - [ ] Add different bubble types (regular, gold)
  - [ ] Implement click detection

- [ ] Create AudioManager class (audio.js)
  - [ ] Implement Web Audio API initialization
  - [ ] Create pop sound generation
  - [ ] Create level complete sound sequences
  - [ ] Create game over sound effects

## Phase 3: Game Engine
- [ ] Create main game loop (game.js)
  - [ ] Implement 60 FPS rendering loop
  - [ ] Add bubble spawning system
  - [ ] Implement collision detection
  - [ ] Add game state management

- [ ] Canvas rendering system
  - [ ] Background gradient rendering
  - [ ] Bubble rendering with effects
  - [ ] UI overlay rendering
  - [ ] Performance optimization

## Phase 4: User Interface
- [ ] Create HTML structure (index.html)
  - [ ] Game canvas element
  - [ ] Score/timer/level displays
  - [ ] Control buttons
  - [ ] Game information panel

- [ ] Implement CSS styling (styles.css)
  - [ ] Glassmorphism effects
  - [ ] Responsive button designs
  - [ ] Animation keyframes
  - [ ] Modal overlays for game states

## Phase 5: Game Logic Integration
- [ ] Connect all components
  - [ ] Wire up event handlers
  - [ ] Implement game flow (start/pause/restart)
  - [ ] Add level progression triggers
  - [ ] Implement game over conditions

- [ ] Add visual feedback systems
  - [ ] Level completion overlays
  - [ ] Game over screens
  - [ ] Score animations
  - [ ] Button hover effects

## Phase 6: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
  - [ ] Chrome compatibility
  - [ ] Firefox compatibility  
  - [ ] Safari compatibility
  - [ ] Edge compatibility

- [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Memory leak prevention
  - [ ] Rendering optimization
  - [ ] Audio system stability
  - [ ] Input responsiveness

- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements
  - [ ] Edge case handling
  - [ ] Error message improvements
  - [ ] Code review and cleanup
  - [ ] Documentation updates

## Phase 7: Repository Management
- [ ] Git repository setup
  - [ ] Initialize local repository
  - [ ] Create remote repository (dbbuilder/bubblegame)
  - [ ] Push initial commit
  - [ ] Set up proper .gitignore

- [ ] Version control best practices
  - [ ] Commit each feature separately
  - [ ] Write meaningful commit messages
  - [ ] Tag releases appropriately
  - [ ] Create development branches

## Priority Order
1. **HIGH**: Core game mechanics (Phases 2-3)
2. **HIGH**: Basic UI and controls (Phase 4)
3. **MEDIUM**: Integration and polish (Phases 5-6)
4. **LOW**: Repository setup (Phase 7)

## Current Focus
**Next Steps**: Start with GameState class implementation, then move to Bubble class, followed by AudioManager.

## Notes
- Each JavaScript file should be self-contained with proper error handling
- All functions should include comprehensive logging for debugging
- CSS should be modular and well-commented
- HTML should be semantic and accessible
